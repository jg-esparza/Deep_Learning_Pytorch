    "\n",
    "The first step here is to add all the dependencies. We need os for file input/output functionality, as we will save the CIFAR-10 dataset to local disk later in this tutorial. We'll also import torch, which imports PyTorch. From it we import nn, which allows us to define a neural network module. We also import the DataLoader (for feeding data into the MLP during training), the CIFAR10 dataset (for obvious purposes) and transforms, which allows us to perform transformations on the data prior to feeding it to the MLP."

It has two definitions: __init__, or the constructor, and forward, which implements the forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the constructor, we first invoke the superclass initialization and then define the layers of our neural network. We stack all layers (three densely-connected layers with Linear and ReLU activation functions using nn.Sequential. We also add nn.Flatten() at the start. Flatten converts the 3D image representations (width, height and channels) into 1D format, which is necessary for Linear layers. Note that with image data it is often best to use Convolutional Neural Networks. This is out of scope for this tutorial and will be covered in another one.\n",

    "The forward pass allows us to react to input data - for example, during the training process. In our case, it does nothing but feeding the data through the neural network layers, and returning the output."
